Typescript node module template
===============================

Basic template for creating typescript node modules with mocha and wallaby test suites.

### Howto

* `npm install` - install dependencies
* `npm test` - run tests
* `npm run test:w` - run tests in watch mode
* `npm run compile` - compile your code into the `lib/` folder
* `wallaby start` in ms code to see tests and code coverage as you type

*Make sure you have node and `npm` installed - wallaby requires you to install the `wallabyjs` plugin in your editor*

*Note depends on Typescript 2.1+ theres added MS Code config*

### Todo

* Add better documentation / get started docs
* Add ts-linting?
* Add istanbul code coverage?

Kind regards
